Lessons Learned:
--
Fuzzing: Learning to spot typing and variable assignment issues is extremely valuable to fix issues in code to minimize unexpected behavior when dealing with user and file input when you canâ€™t guarantee  its integrity.

GitHub Actions: Learning to have GitHub automate scripts running can help find bugs when dealing with large repositories with many contributors.

Git Hook: Git hooks help prevent bad code from being commited and showing possible errors and functionality issues to the user before commiting

Forensics: Constant logging allow program tracking to quickly locate bugged code when dealing with large codebases
